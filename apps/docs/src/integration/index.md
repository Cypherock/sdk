# Integration

## Prerequisite

Follow the steps below before integrating the Cypherock SDK into your application:

### Step 1

Identify which [HW Connect](../hw_connect.md) technology you can use with your application.

As a general rule, you can `WebUSB` if you are integrating in a website and `HID` 
on `NodeJS/ElectronJS` applications.

### Step 2

Identify which [SDK Applications](../apps/index.md) you'll need to interact with.

## Example Integrations

- [WebApp](./webapp.md)
- [NodeJS](./node.md)
